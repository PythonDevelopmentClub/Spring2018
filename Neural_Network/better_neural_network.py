		@author Devin Uner
		this is a module for creating neural networks of arbitrary size
		it has several methods available, but mostly you should use the train, and get_output methods
		leave everything else alone, thats all private (mostly math) stuff

		EXAMPLE
		# create a network with 2 input neurons, 3 hidden neurons, 2 more hidden neurons, and one output neuron
		my_NN = Neural_Network([2, 3, 2, 1])
		# train it
		for i in range(1000):
			my_NN.train([0,0], [0])
			my_NN.train([0,1], [1])
			my_NN.train([1,0], [1])
		# get the output of something its never seen
		#print my_NN.get_output([1,1])
